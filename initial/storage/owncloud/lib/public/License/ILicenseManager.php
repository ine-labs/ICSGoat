	 * If there no valid license and the grace period has finished, this method
	 * will disable the app.
	 *
	 * Implementations can provide additional options to customize this behaviour. Check
	 * the implementations for details.

	 * - startGracePeriod => true/false (default true): in order to start the grace period or not
	 * - disableApp => true/false (default true): to disable the app under the above conditions or not
