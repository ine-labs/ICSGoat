 *
 * Implementations are expected to have a constructor accepting an array of parameter such as
 * ['key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2']. They should be able to create an instance with
 * those parameters. If any required parameter is missing and the object can't be created,
 * implementation should throw an \InvalidArgumentException in the constructor. Note that there
 * shouldn't be any connection being made to any data source in the constructor.
