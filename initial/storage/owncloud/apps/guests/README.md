Create a guest user by typing his email address in to the sharing dialog. The guest
will receive an email invite with a link to create an account. He has only access

Furthermore, the administrator has to whitelist the applications that guests can use.
By default settings, avatar, files_external, files_trashbin, files_versions, files_sharing, files_texteditor, activity, firstrunwizard, gallery, notifications, password_policy and oauth2 are allowed.
