	<description>
This application enables admins to configure ownCloud to connect to SharePoint 2007, 2010 and 2013 document libraries and provide access to end users. By assigning a SharePoint document library to a group, user or the whole system, admins can easily provide mobile and desktop sync for files stored in SharePoint.
Once a SharePoint document library is mounted by the admin, users see a folder structure that mirrors their SharePoint document library. Users can selectively sync these files to the desktop, or access them on a mobile device like any other ownCloud file. The files, however, remain stored in SharePoint as the system of record. Note: this application requires the installation of the PHP SOAP module, available in your distribution. More information is available in the SharePoint documentation.
